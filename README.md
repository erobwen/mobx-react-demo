# About

This MobX/React/Vite demo was made to demonstrate lean but powerful state management with MobX. There are various examples of how to use state with MobX and React, with code for each example. There are a number of original helper-classes and hooks that make React integration particularly lean and efficient.

It also showcases a standard authentication and admin interface. 

# Running

Do this to run in dev mode. 

1. npm install
2. npm start
3. Find the demo at: http://localhost:5173/ 

(Note: When starting the app, the console ends with just some vite update, and seems stalled. But the url was printed out earlier on the console, and the app is working.)

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# Project log
